# Futuris-Strike
Futuris Strike is a futuristic arcade-style video game, inspired by the classic 70s arcade game, PONG. 

With neon graphics, vectors that render to vanishing points, and techno-style fonts, this game gives a retro concept a new, 2024 makeover. A note to any followers: This UI may be used for future projects, so keep an eye out for it ;)

The classic colour #0ff (think light blue, but ultra futuristic) dominates the dark colour scheme, as well as shades of blue and white.
